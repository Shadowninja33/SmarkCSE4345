# Smark

A Software Engineering Class project. Our goal is to create a parking space sensor that will be able to detect if a space is available and make that information avaiable on a mobile friendly website. This project is being built to reduce the time wasted by students and faculty when trying to they try to find a free parking space. The sensor periodically pings to determine if it is covered and sends that information to our database. That information is then retrieved by the user through our web application and displayed in a table.
